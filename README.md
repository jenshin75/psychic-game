This game randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose.

When the user guesses what letter the computer is thinking of, the following counts are generated:

- Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

- Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

- Guesses Left: (# of guesses left - this will update automatically) 
    - Max guess = 10

- Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed). 
    - The user choices will be displayed until the user either wins or loses.)

- When the player wins, the Wins counter will be increased and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

- When the player loses, the Losses counter will be increased and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
